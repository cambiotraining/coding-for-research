## Context
We’ve seen examples where we entered data directly into a function. Most of the time we have data from elsewhere, such as a spreadsheet. We’ll build up from a single object; vector; tabular data; brief mention of others (matrices, arrays - linking to day 3)

## Objects

### Creating objects
LO: create objects

### Using objects
LO: using objects (calculations etc)

### Vectors

LO: subsetting (indices, conditionals with TRUE/FALSE)

### Dealing with missing data
LO: why is missing data important?
LO: good practices of dealing with missing data
