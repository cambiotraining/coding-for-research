## Context
We now have a good grasp of how data is commonly structured, with variables in columns and observations in rows. This is the perfect format for visualising data.

## Introducing plotting

To create a plot we'll need three things:

1. data
2. mapping aesthetics
3. specify the type of plot

## R
